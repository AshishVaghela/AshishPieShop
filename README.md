Here you see the application that is a web shop for Pies. 
Ashish's pie shop has a landing page where a selection pies of the week is shown. I can click on any of these pies, and then I'll go to the detail page of that particular pie. 
I can then add that to my shopping cart. We can also browse the entire catalog of pies by clicking on the Pies menu that will then expand all the pies per category.
When you check out, you see a order form to fill out the details and your order will be on your way!

This application is developed in **ASP.NET Core 3 C#** language. **Entitiy Framework** is used here for data modeling. **Authorization and Authentication** like user Register and user login are also part of this project. 

Further improvements will be done with time.
